            Much of the regions economy is focused on collection of goods from
            the nearby Lake Sabastian and from the hills and forests which
            surround it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The region focuses mostly on agriculture and have become mostly
            self-sufficient, priding themselves on requiring little imports from
            the rest of Maldantis.

            Most people of Aristeium and Lorn speak primarily common, though
            many merchants will learn a small amount of elven to trade with the
            odd wood elf who makes their way south from Nalia.

          <p>
            The state religion of Maldantis is the Church of Taro, though Lorn
            is known for its independence so there is a sizable population of
            Orthodox Aeinists.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the regions reliance and almost veneration of the lake, many
            members of the Church of Ul feel welcome.

            In contrast to much of the surrounding region Aristeium and Lorn are
            ruled by a dual-government.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ancient monarchy of Aristeium has maintained their rule while
            allowing for the church to act as a second chair. As such, the
            region is ruled by Sevtus royal family and the current High Pontiff
            Malik.

          <p>
            There have been many influences from Nalia, though the people take
            pride in their culture and often see elven dishes as not robust
            enough.
