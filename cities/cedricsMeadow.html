                    Being an outlier in mainland Hogreve in a largely open centralized plains-land
                    with a large river running nearby makes this an agricultural hotspot.
                    Much of the income of the town and the surrounding villages is taken up
                    entirely by farming though there is a sizeable market for retail goods,
                    mostly just to fuel the agricultural heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the goods produced here are sent to Barpool and other coastal
                    settlements that are not able to sustain themselves on their own farms.

                    All of those that live in Cedric's Meadow know and speak common regularly,
                    though many take up Elven as a second language to assist in trade and to
                    converse with the sizeable population of elves which live in the region.

                <p>
                    Surprisingly, Dwarvish is also popular and many will take words from the
                    language and use them regularly without taking on the language for common speech.

                    Due to their proximity to Maldantis the town and region has a significant
                    number of members of the Church of Taro, though due to the fact that they
                    are not in the demographical region or in a kingdom which cites the religion
                    as their national religion, most people are Orthodox Aeinists.
                    Aeinists outnumber Tarans 2:1.

                    Cedric's Meadow sits on the outskirts of the large economic and governmental
                    region of Barpool meaning that it falls under the governance of the East
                    Barpool Company. It is a very important town both as a bread-basket and as
                    a defensive position since it sits in the valley between Barpool and Maldantis.

                        and Maldantis. Still a heavily guarded and fortified location.

                    Being a ways away from the coast, Cedric's Meadow does not share the culinary
                    pallet of the rest of the nation, instead it relied much more on staple crops
                    and more simple stews and dishes constructed from what is readily available.

                    Much of the town is surrounded by large expanses of forest, with the region
                    adjacent to Erala Tell being mostly cleared for lumber and for road construction.
                    The towns exist in a lowland between two larger regions to the north and south
                    which hold the northern tip of the Itruskin Forest and the bulk of the Ir'anya
                    Forest to the north.

                    Cedric's Meadow was built directly adjacent to Erala Tell, a major waterway
                    which leads to Barpool. The river is used extensively as a means of transporting goods.

                    Lying in a low valley near a river, the rains from the coast are often funneled

                    The region is a hotspot for interesting creatures. The forests and hills create
                    ample space for larger monsters and beasts to hide and hunt and with limited
                    hunting in the regions further into the forests, they have been able to flourish
                    for thousands of years.

                        This is because this family of Owlbear do not have the solitary instincts
                        of their cousins and instead form parliaments of Owlbears averaging around
                        6 adults with 3-4 young.
